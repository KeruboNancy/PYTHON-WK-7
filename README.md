# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This initiative investigates the progression, effects, and vaccination advancements of the COVID-19 pandemic in **Kenya**, **USA**, and **India**. It leverages publicly accessible data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus ), incorporating time-series visualizations, death rate assessments, vaccine distribution tracking, and comparative insights into how the pandemic unfolded across these countries.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Examine trends in total and new cases and deaths related to COVID-19.
- Assess and contrast the pace and effectiveness of vaccination rollouts among the selected nations.
- Compute and analyze the case fatality ratio (i.e., death rate).
- Detect inconsistencies, missing information, or recurring patterns in reported statistics.
- Present key findings visually for clearer understanding and narrative clarity.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ for creating informative visualizations  
- **NumPy** â€“ for numerical computations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for interactive and exploratory data analysis

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` notebook file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-analysis.git

2. Install necessary packages if not already installed
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

4. Open the notebook file (covid19_analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to explore the data and visualizations.

## Project Structure

. covid19_analysis.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
. README.md: This file â€” provides an overview and setup instructions.
. data/: Directory containing downloaded datasets (if applicable).
. figures/: Folder for generated visualizations (if saved).

## Key Insights

. Time-series visualizations reveal the peaks and plateaus in infections and deaths.
. Vaccination progress varies significantly between countries in terms of speed and coverage.
. Case fatality rates highlight differences in healthcare response and population demographics.
. Data anomalies may suggest reporting inconsistencies or policy changes over time.
